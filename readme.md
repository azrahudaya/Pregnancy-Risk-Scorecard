# Pregnancy Risk Scorecard

**Pregnancy Risk Scorecard** is a simple web application that helps assess the risk level of a pregnant woman based on various health and pregnancy-related factors. It provides a score and classifies the pregnancy into one of three risk categories: Low Risk, High Risk, or Very High Risk. The scorecard also gives recommendations on care providers, referral needs, and suggested delivery locations.

## Features

- Provides a risk score and classifies the pregnancy as Low Risk, High Risk, or Very High Risk.
- Offers recommendations on where the delivery should take place and whether a referral is needed.
- Simple and intuitive user interface built with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design.

## Risk Levels

- **Low Risk (KRR)**: No need for referral, delivery can take place at a local village clinic (POLINDES) with a midwife.
- **High Risk (KRT)**: Referral to a health center or hospital is needed, with both a midwife and a doctor assisting in delivery.
- **Very High Risk (KRST)**: Immediate referral to a hospital is required, and the delivery must be handled by a doctor.
